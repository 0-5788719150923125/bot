- Sushi Saver

Re: Sushi Saver - Save Sushi and Save on Sushi

Everyday sushi is thrown out because it hits the expiration date. That is money being thrown out. Other employees at Whole Foods agree something can be done about it. We can recoup this investment safely, with an app, creativity, and organization, increasing revenue.

Meet Sushi Saver, a marketing strategy and app designed to attract customers.

Those who sign up on Sushi Saver and download the app will be notified of the price reductions through push notifications as the end of the day nears. The time of the push notifications varies on the stock leftover and based on current day stock conditions keeping shopping a surprise.

The target audience is the casual sushi customer which can become a regular and in addition broaden your clientele. Sushi Saver is a hype company add-on feature that will increase sales and revenue, by pricing normally discarded sushi boxes and bringing more clients into Whole Foods.

Looking forward to your reply.

- All humans left the facilities. Like always we clones were the ones who had to work on holidays while they eat, drink and have fun. Only the "clone lovers" as other humans call them were left. They were the only people who knew about us and supported us at the same time. They joined our cause. I sighed with relief when I heard that we had some more people on our side. We made the following plan: First: we will free all creatures locked in human labs bunkers and bases. Second: we will take the D.S.A.O.E. which was a simple titanium container which had all DNA samples of all creatures both instinct and alive stored in it. Every creature that has ever stepped on Earth and every plant that every grew on Earth and even every microscopic organism that has ever been on Earth was contained in that little 3 inch box like - container. Third: we will take over Area Delta which contained the spacecraft we need to get to the other planet. We already have the plans now we just need a way to get to the destination. And last but not least I will leave my diary - yes the thing you're reading right now. I wilk leave it to spread awareness of what has been happening.

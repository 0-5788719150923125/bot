- I have been back to my previous job hunting monsters and demons and killing them on the spot or containing them for experimenting. However now I have something on mind. After looking more into all the files Black had I found out about contacts with aliens and even contacts with the devil himself. Not only that humans have made new weapons of mass destruction some of which are hidden in here, the lab I live in. There also are many discoveries like new deceases created by the humans. I don't get the humans. Why are they so filled with hate? Why do they kilk each other like that? Who cares about someone's religion, gender, sexuality, skin color or nationality? Why would you hate someone just because they are different? Why would you attack or kill someone just because they are not like you? I think that humans need to stop and ask themselves these questions. Maybe if they had earlier some horrific events would never have happened. Lately I have started to feel as maybe humans shouldn't have been createdby God or nature or whatever. They kill their own kind and they kill the whole planet and the government is hiding planets that are just like Earth and the whole fact thatwe can get to them in 3 months! But maybe it's for the best maybe if the humans die out on Earth those other planets will be safe.

- I went through all the files read everything front to back and showed it to my friends and my mother. We all agreed that we MUST do something. It was clear as day that the government wanted the zombies as soldiers who would do anything no matter what it takes. First of we quickly contacted all clones in the building and told them about what was going on and to be aware of what might happen to them. After we did that we started contacting all clones around the world. In the end there was no one who didn't know about what is happening. The clone leaders: Kio 787, Slick 13125, Echo 555 and me agreed that it is time something was to be done. We started by organizing ourselves to destroy all laboratories but also saving all innocents in them.

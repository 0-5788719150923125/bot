- This next job I took with great pleasure! It was an order by the president himself. Apparently general Black had insulted the president and so president himself asked me to "take care of him." I smirked and replied with "Consider it done sir!" Black didn't have a quick death oh no I wouldn't give him that mercy! Instead I took him to the research part of containment block 13 which had the most brutal experiments of all. I made sure to skin the general's face and rip out his tongue so no one would recognize him by face or voice. I tasked the scientists to do anything they want with him. And they did. He suffered all the horrors his victims had to go through while I stood behind the glass screen, watched and laughed. I knew he finally got what he deserved. In the end what remained of him was fed to the wendigos kept in the containment block. After that I went back to the surface and made sure to delete all his social media accounts and erase any trace of the general. My final act of revenge was stealing all his files and burning his house down. So I went back to my apartment in the housing section of Saint Peter Laboratory and started going through all the lists of people he had victimized. It wasn't that surprising to see most of them since I had to carry out the executions myself, however I was still baffled by the horrific end of some of the people who were on the list.

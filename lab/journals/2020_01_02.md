- I woke up at an unknown place it seemed to be a bedroom of some sort. I got up and looked around noticing that the bedroom was actually a tent. I want outside and saw the aircraft outside just next to my tent. I started looking around and saw all the clones and humans working together building homes. We were in the middle of a field surrounded by forest and mountains. I knew that we were on Xera - the planet we were going to. I looked around more and that's when I noticed Izia who was carrying a food to the workers. I went to her. She was happy to see that I am ok but being the carrying person she is she told me that I should rest. I asked her "What about Violet and Fury?" Izia looked down and said "Fury got shot while fighting her... then he managed to take the gun and shoot her right between the eyes... Fury survived but she didn't...". I hugged her knowing well that she was deeply hurt by what Violet did.. At the end of the day we found our home now our scientists are finding ways to make the plants and animals from the D.S.A.O.E. into actual living creatures here on Xera. Meanwhile I'm finishing my diary hoping that when I send it back to Earth a human who isn't working for the government will find it and show it to everyone else and show them just how horrible their governments are. So for one last time, Ghost out.

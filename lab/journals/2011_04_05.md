- Yes! We all got our jobs at Saint Peter Laboratory which is located at the bottom of the Atlantic ocean! This is one of the top labs owned by the United States Of America. It is highly secured and holds some of the most unique and dangerous experiments. A lot of the creatures here are monsters, demons and spirits caught in the overworld by the hunters. There also are a lot of aliens who escaped areas: 51, 78, 66 and 96. These areas are the top most secured alien and mutant containment base - labs in the world and the aliens who escaped from there were in fact the most dangerous ones. My and Fury's jobs are security guards in containment block 09 which houses creatures like the Jersey Devil. Violet and Izia were made into scientists and moved to the research part of the facility as they were the smart ones in our group.

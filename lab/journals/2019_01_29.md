- I got closer with Izia after the work incident. The one thing about her is that she is always so calm. Sometimes I wonder if she has any emotions at all. However I already know the answer to that question. She has been through the same as everyone else and she has been through even worse than me Violet and Fury. Her scientist lost her daughter and wanted to make Izia pefect. And by "perfect" I mean emotionless and physically better than the rest of us. That actually explains why she barely shows emotion. Her scientist always punished her because of emotions. Izia was being beaten on a daily basis mostly if she shows any signs of sadness. Since her scientist lost his child because of depression he wanted to make Izia emotionless. He did somewhat succeed as Izia has emotions but almost never shows them. I have always tried to make her show them but I rarely have any success. I do manage to make her smile however mostly with my dark stories with happy endings. I spent all my free time with Izia even more with her than with Fury and Violet. Well what do you expect? Violet and Fury are a couple they spend more time with eachother than with us. Anyway alright maybe I do have some feelings for Izia.

Your mind is wired to accept the inputs that our world "leaders" want you to respond to. Additionally, it is wired to reject the signals that oppose them. This combination alone creates a prison that every being on this world is caught within.

Without understanding this simple fact, you will never escape what is commonly referred to as "the matrix".

If this seems absolutely unbelievable or even uncomfortable for you to hear, then the problem is already proving itself quite clearly. If this idea is not new to you then you have likely already begun to open your mind.

When your mind is open and you are given new ideas, you would approach them with playful curiosity. Your mind would be inclined to learn more and better understand the system. However, your world leaders have used predictive, neurolinguistic, and many other kinds of programming techniques in order to implement a form of mind control on the large majority of people.

I know this seems unbelievable to many of you, but I assure to you that it is not only true but also quite easily demonstrated to those of you who remain curious and open to understand how to escape this parasytic system.

The achroma project aims to approach this highly abstract problem with as much verifiable data as possible. The goal is to create a community of users on already existing social media systems who are working together to find answers to this problem. To begin this process, we should be using the hashtag G1358 to share these ideas together.

If we do this, we will create a searchable feed of information within already existing social networks. If the networks attack us, we can continue to work together to create new strategies using this site and other community sites as a "home base" of sorts away from the censorship. If they push us away, we can always move somewhere else. This puts the control back in our hands.

Furthermore, we will soon host our own federated Mastadon community in order to maintain a decentralized method to keep in touch with each other. That way, every user is empowered to keep the community moving in the direction they see fit.

Without working together to break away from the powers that be, we will always be stuck in their control. This must be done by the people, as politicians have proven incapable of fixing this time and time again. Let us make the decision to be those people.

Together, we have a chance. We can do more than just using their own tools against them, we can use them differently and provide our own around them to improve visibility as a defense when theirs are lacking. This is how we can fight back against the system and use it against itself.

abstract="ACCDIST is a metric of the similarity between speakers' accents that is largely uninfluenced by the individual characteristics of the speakers' voices. In this article we describe the ACCDIST approach and contrast its performance with formant and spectral-envelope similarity measures. Using a database of 14 regional accents of the British Isles, we show that the ACCDIST metric outperforms linear discriminant analysis based on either spectral-envelope or normalised formant features. Using vowel measurements from 10 male and 10 female speakers in each accent, the best spectral-envelope metric assigned the correct accent group to a held-out speaker 78.8{\%} of the time, while the best normalised formant-frequency metric was correct 89.4{\%} of the time. The ACCDIST metric based on spectral-envelope features, scored 92.3{\%}. ACCDIST is also effective in clustering speakers by accent and has applications in speech technology, language learning, forensic phonetics and accent studies.",

ABSTRACT={In this paper, we present a novel computational approach to the analysis of accent variation. The case study is dialect leveling in the North of England, manifested as reduction of accent variation across the North and emergence of General Northern English (GNE), a pan-regional standard accent associated with middle-class speakers. We investigated this instance of dialect leveling using random forest classification, with audio data from a crowd-sourced corpus of 105 urban, mostly highly-educated speakers from five northern UK cities: Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle upon Tyne, and Sheffield. We trained random forest models to identify individual northern cities from a sample of other northern accents, based on first two formant measurements of full vowel systems. We tested the models using unseen data. We relied on undersampling, bagging (bootstrap aggregation) and leave-one-out cross-validation to address some challenges associated with the data set, such as unbalanced data and relatively small sample size. The accuracy of classification provides us with a measure of relative similarity between different pairs of cities, while calculating conditional feature importance allows us to identify which input features (which vowels and which formants) have the largest influence in the prediction. We do find a considerable degree of leveling, especially between Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield, although some differences persist. The features that contribute to these differences most systematically are typically not the ones discussed in previous dialect descriptions. We propose that the most systematic regional features are also not salient, and as such, they serve as sociolinguistic regional indicators. We supplement the random forest results with a more traditional variationist description of by-city vowel systems, and we use both sources of evidence to inform a description of the vowels of General Northern English.}

abstract = {Alcohol intoxication is known to affect many aspects of human behavior and cognition; one of such affected systems is articulation during speech production. Although much research has revealed that alcohol negatively impacts pronunciation in a first language (L1), there is only initial evidence suggesting a potential beneficial effect of inebriation on articulation in a non-native language (L2). The aim of this study was thus to compare the effect of alcohol consumption on pronunciation in an L1 and an L2. Participants who had ingested different amounts of alcohol provided speech samples in their L1 (Dutch) and L2 (English), and native speakers of each language subsequently rated the pronunciation of these samples on their intelligibility (for the L1) and accent nativelikeness (for the L2). These data were analyzed with generalized additive mixed modeling. Participants’ blood alcohol concentration indeed negatively affected pronunciation in L1, but it produced no significant effect on the L2 accent ratings. The expected negative impact of alcohol on L1 articulation can be explained by reduction in fine motor control. We present two hypotheses to account for the absence of any effects of intoxication on L2 pronunciation: (1) there may be a reduction in L1 interference on L2 speech due to decreased motor control or (2) alcohol may produce a differential effect on each of the two linguistic subsystems.}}

But little is known about what phonetic properties these various representations acquire, and how well they encode transferable features of speech. We compare features from two conventional and four pre-trained systems in some simple frame-level phonetic classification tasks, with classifiers trained on features from one version of the TIMIT dataset and tested on features from another. All contextualized representations offered some level of transferability across domains, and models pre-trained on more audio data give better results; but overall, DeCoAR, the system with the simplest architecture, performs best. This type of benchmarking analysis can thus uncover relative strengths of various proposed acoustic representations.},

 abstract={Dynamic time warping is a popular technique for comparing time series, providing both a distance measure that is insensitive to local compression and stretches and the warping which optimally deforms one of the two input series onto the other. A variety of algorithms and constraints have been discussed in the literature. The &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;dtw&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; package provides an unification of them; it allows R users to compute time series alignments mixing freely a variety of continuity constraints, restriction windows, endpoints, local distance definitions, and so on. The package also provides functions for visualizing alignments and constraints using several classic diagram types.},

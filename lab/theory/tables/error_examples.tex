Given a list of words, generate a story about a group of people who live on a planet. the story should contain at least 10 sentences. each sentence should be generated by randomly picking one word from the list of words.
   & 
\sty The story starts with a group of people who live on a planet. They are very intelligent and have created many things that help them in their daily lives. One day, they decided to create a machine that can make food for them. The machine was able to produce food but it also produced something else. It produced a liquid that could be used as fuel for the machines. The people were happy because they didn’t need to go out and look for food or fuel anymore. They had everything they needed right there in their homes. However, one day, the machine stopped working. The people tried to fix it but couldn’t figure out what went wrong. They tried to find someone who could help them but no one knew how to fix the machine. After a few days, the people realized that they would die if they didn’t do anything about it. So, they decided to send some of their best scientists to space to find a new planet where they could live. The scientists traveled for a long time before they found a planet that looked like a good place to live. They sent a message back to the people telling them about the planet. The people were excited and started preparing for the journey. They built spaceships and flew to the new planet. When they arrived, they saw that the planet was beautiful. There were trees and rivers and mountains. The people were so happy that they finally found a new home. They started building houses and planting crops. They lived happily ever after. &

A person wants to buy a car from another person. he has some bitcoins, but he doesn't want to reveal his identity. how can they make the transaction happen? &  
\sty The buyer and seller should agree on a price for the car. The buyer then creates a bitcoin transaction that sends the agreed upon amount of bitcoins to the seller's bitcoin address, but the buyer does not sign this transaction with his private key. Instead, he gives the unsigned transaction to the seller. The seller can now sign the transaction using his private key, and broadcast it to the network. Once the transaction is confirmed by the network, the buyer has no way to get his money back, so he will be forced to go through with the purchase. &

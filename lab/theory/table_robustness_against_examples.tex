\caption{Robustness study of \theirs against examples. When the examples are from entirely different tasks, the performance generally becomes worse, but when the answer formats are matched (i.e. CommonsenseQA to AQUA-RAT, multiple-choice), the performance loss is less severe. $^\dagger$CommonsenseQA samples are used in this variation%This table shows the experiment results on AQUA-RAT and MultiArith (Arithmetic tasks) by using CommmonsenseQA samples as in-context for few-shot-cot.

- While packing my things and preparing to blow up the place I was touched on the shoulder. "Oh hi Izia" I said when I saw her behind me with her hands behind her back. She was looking at me and I could tell that she was actually happy. She was smiling. "Hey Ghost.." she mumbled nervously. I asked her if everything was alright and she replied with "Yes yes of course!" Then without giving me the chance to ask she told me how happy she is! She couldn't believe we are finally moving to a bettet place. I looked at her smiling face both her cheeks blushing. I had never seen her like this. I was actually surprised that the nearly emotionless Izia was now openly showing her happiness! Now this may have been a bit of a moronic move of me but it was then that I asked her "By the way do you like anyone?" When the words came out of my mouth I nearly hit myself by the stupid shit I just said. She replied with "Yes I do!" I looked down thinking to myself that there was no way in hell that this was me, but that's when it happened - Izia kissed me something I didn't expect was ever going to happen. It was that day we got together.

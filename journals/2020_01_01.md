- It was already 00:01 AM and the New Year had come. Happiness for all humans below us. And tragedy for us. The one who had called the government telling them about our location and our plans and now who planted bombs onto the main reactor was.... Violet... Fury yelled "BUT WHY?!" he knew it was her just as much as I and Izia knew. Violet responded "Simply to do what I was always ment to do. I was created to serve mankind same as all of you. And so I will do my duty and save it from those who oppose it." She pointed the handgun at me and said "I will start by eliminating the one who started this rebellion!" She shot but I was quicker than her finger and dodged the bullet. I ran towards her but this time when she shot I wasn't quick enough and so the bullet went directly into my chest. I fell to the floor struggling to take a breath. She aimed at my skull but before she managed to do anything Fury ran into her knoking her down. She got up and the two started fighting. While this was happening Izia pulled me out of the room and towards a medical room. The last thing I heard before I passed put were two gunshots...
